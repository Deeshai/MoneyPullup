How Analytics was used in Video Game
- I kept the analytics as simplistic as possible.
- Right now it just keeps track of the flow of the game.
- It checks if a level has been started and if the has been completed (Code can be found in Player Controller and each Win Menu Scripts)
- All data will be collected on my Unity Dashboard Online through the Funnel Analyzer.
- This data will be used to track how hard a level is to beat and if a user can successfully go through each level. 
- If the rate at which a level is completed is less than the rate at which it is started, then I will know to edit the difficulty of the maze.
- Analytics are also used with Ads to check if it has started, if the viewer watched the entire Ad, if the viewer has skipped the Ad and if the user 
has clicked on the Ad. (Code can be found in Ads script)
- All data will be collected on my Unity Dashboard Online through the Funnel Analyzer.
- This will be used to see how many times a viewer sees the Ad and their response to seeing it. (Explained more in Ads Section below)

How Advertisments was used in Video Game
- I decided to use a skippable video Ad that plays everytime you lose a level in the game.
- This is done to force players to try and master the level and complete it.
- Nobody likes to see Ads, so I am using it to force more game play time.
- It is used with analytics to mainly see if players actually start winning levels after seeing Ads everytime they lose a level.


How Audio was used in Video Game
- To the average person the audio used in this game seems somewhat random, but to my target audience of Caribbean young adults,
the audio brings with it a sense of nostalgia of Jamaican and Caribbean culture.
- Within each level the audio is set to a randomization of sound levels, which gives a slight echoing effect.
- Every piece audio takes you on ride through a "Dance" (Jamaican Party), with slight remnants of the culture.
- Below is a break down of Audio in my game and why it was used:

Music and Sound Effects
Main Menu Music
I chose to use “Welcome to Jamrock” by Damian Marley, it serves as a simple but effective way to welcome you to my video game.

Winning Music
I chose to use a snippet of “World Cup” by Popcaan, the snippet repeats “A we still a win”.

Game Over Music
I chose to use a snippet of “Bomboclaat” by Peter Tosh. This was chosen because of the general term used to express when they have lost a game is “Bomboclaat”, another word used is “Raasclaat”, which also said in the snippet.
There is also a overlapping "Bomboclaat" sound bite played at the same time. This is reminiscent of DJing culture and play at parties in the Caribbean.

Energy Pill Collection Sound Effect
I decided to use a common sound effect “Oh” which was created from something a Jamaican artist Vybz Kartel used to say on his records. Vybz Kartel is very famous amongst the teens and young adults of Jamaica.
There is a slight echo placed on sound bite, which gives the vybe of a "Dance" (Jamaican Party) with loud speakers, echoing accross the community.

Loss of Life Sound Effect
A common sound effect, I decided to use the cop siren to warn the player that they have lost a life.
